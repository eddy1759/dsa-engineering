**Purpose: Quick lookup of which pattern solves which problem.**

**Example for Two Sum:**


# DSA Pattern Index

| Pattern | Problem | File (TS) | File (Python) | Notes |
|---------|---------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Brute Force | Two Sum | patterns/arrays/two-sum.ts | patterns/arrays/two-sum.py | Simple O(n²) approach |
| Hash Map | Two Sum | patterns/hash-map/two-sum.ts | patterns/hash-map/two-sum.py | O(n) using complement lookup |
| Brute Force    | Two Sum II          | patterns/arrays/two-sum-bruteforce.ts            | patterns/arrays/two-sum-bruteforce.py             | Ignores sorted constraint |
| Two Pointers   | Two Sum II (Sorted) | patterns/two-pointers/two-sum-ii.ts               | patterns/two-pointers/two-sum-ii.py               | Optimal O(n) |

## Notes
- Problems may appear multiple times under different patterns.
- Folder placement reflects **strategy**, not LeetCode category.
